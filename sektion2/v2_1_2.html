<h2>Teaching a Global History of Science: Challenges and Opportunities</h2>
<p>This talk addresses the process of creating a new module in University College London alongside calls to ‘Decolonize the Curriculum’. Activism in this area has developed in a productive interaction with changing historiographies, including a turn to postcolonial histories of science, empire, and non-European natural knowledges. My course “What is a Global History of Science?” seeks to present a counter-narrative to traditional Eurocentric accounts of the development of modern science, by exploring common themes and particularities in natural knowledges in a variety of historical and geographical settings around the globe, in Africa, South America, India, Russia, and Japan. Developing the module, in dialogue with programs to decolonize the curriculum, raises questions, to be addressed in this presentation, concerning the identity of the lecturer, the power of language, relations between historical and contemporary inequities and injustices, and the status of science and education in modern universities.</p>
