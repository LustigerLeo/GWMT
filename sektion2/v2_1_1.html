<h2>Challenges in Studying Feminist and Environmental Activism: Navigating calls for Co-Creation in the Horizon Europe program</h2>
<p>This presentation addresses the unique challenges of studying (both historical and contemporary) feminist and environmental activism within the constraints of EU Calls, with a particular focus on integrating co-creation approaches. Emphasis is placed on the complexities of avoiding epistemic dominance, establishing participa-tory structures without imposing top-down dynamics, and securing data reliability while steering clear of "becoming native."</p>
<p>In the pursuit of inclusive research, the presentation explores the intricacies of im-plementing co-creation methodologies that empower activists without overshadow-ing their voices. Challenges discussed include navigating the fine line between par-ticipatory engagement and maintaining methodological rigor. Special attention is given to the potential pitfalls of imposing top-down structures in participatory re-search and the imperative of maintaining the reliability of data. The risk of research-ers unintentionally assimilating into activist communities, known as "becoming na-tive," is also addressed, highlighting the need for a balanced and respectful ap-proach. By focusing on these challenges, the presentation aims to provide practical insights into effective strategies for conducting participatory research on the intersection of academic inquiry and grassroots movements.</p>
