<h2>Panel: Activism as the New Normal? Four Trajectories in Resarch and Teaching</h2>
<p>The call for activist research is becoming ever louder in our contemporary world. Despite the numerous activist projects in the 20th century – both in the sciences and (especially) in the arts – the current tone of the call for activism is rather agitated. We see it in quite a few of the requirements for accessing various funding tools e.g. on an EU level; in the call for global perspectives in history-of-science teaching; in the museum sector, where decolonization is a central claim. And we miss it in many projects funded in the context of cooperation-development. It is therefore extremely timely to interrogate ourselves as to how to position our-selves within our respective research and teaching activities with respect to a whole new set of obligations and exigencies that are inherent to the activist requirement. And even more, it appears crucial to us as historians, anthropologists, and episte-mologists of science, not to simply adhere to the ‘new normal’ of activist research, but to interrogate and problematize its pertinence from case to case. In other words, the panel proposes through in-depth descriptions of four research and teaching tra-jectories to raise the following question for discussion: What characterizes adequate or good activist research that does not blindly follow the jargon we are used to read-ing in various pamphlets, but that is able to take into consideration the particularities and vulnerabilities we encounter in specific contexts?</p>

<h4>Challenges in Studying Feminist and Environmental Activism: Navigating calls for Co-Creation in the Horizon Europe program</h4>
<p>This presentation addresses the unique challenges of studying (both historical and contemporary) feminist and environmental activism within the constraints of EU Calls, with a particular focus on integrating co-creation approaches. Emphasis is placed on the complexities of avoiding epistemic dominance, establishing participa-tory structures without imposing top-down dynamics, and securing data reliability while steering clear of "becoming native."</p>
<p>In the pursuit of inclusive research, the presentation explores the intricacies of im-plementing co-creation methodologies that empower activists without overshadow-ing their voices. Challenges discussed include navigating the fine line between par-ticipatory engagement and maintaining methodological rigor. Special attention is given to the potential pitfalls of imposing top-down structures in participatory re-search and the imperative of maintaining the reliability of data. The risk of research-ers unintentionally assimilating into activist communities, known as "becoming na-tive," is also addressed, highlighting the need for a balanced and respectful ap-proach. By focusing on these challenges, the presentation aims to provide practical insights into effective strategies for conducting participatory research on the intersection of academic inquiry and grassroots movements.</p>

<h4>Teaching a Global History of Science: Challenges and Opportunities</h4>
<p>This talk addresses the process of creating a new module in University College London alongside calls to ‘Decolonize the Curriculum’. Activism in this area has developed in a productive interaction with changing historiographies, including a turn to postcolonial histories of science, empire, and non-European natural knowl-edges. My course “What is a Global History of Science?” seeks to present a counter-narrative to traditional Eurocentric accounts of the development of modern science, by exploring common themes and particularities in natural knowledges in a variety of historical and geographical settings around the globe, in Africa, South America, India, Russia, and Japan. Developing the module, in dialogue with programs to de-colonize the curriculum, raises questions, to be addressed in this presentation, con-cerning the identity of the lecturer, the power of language, relations between histori-cal and contemporary inequities and injustices, and the status of science and edu-cation in modern universities.</p>

<h4>Material Humanities. Challenges of object-based research and teaching</h4>
<p>Research through collections has been supported by science policy in Germany for over 10 years. As a result, a university museum was founded in Göttingen and my professorship for the materiality of knowledge was established, where I am trying to expand the curriculum across disciplines with object-based teaching. For this pur-pose, the material environments of the sciences (usually in the form of collections) are used as cognitive spaces, so that students are able to develop new research questions in interaction with the material. The talk will be about the promises that this expansion of the academic understanding of historical sources brings with it, as well as the resistances and questionable points that arise in the process. The activ-ist discourse that I have to face here is decolonization, on the one hand in the sense of returning colonially acquired museum holdings and on the other hand in the sense of the required reinterpretations of these holdings. What is particularly special is that artistic activism plays a formative role in this context.</p>

<h4>Activism in the Context of Development-Collaboration Research?</h4>
<p>This talk reflects on the post- and decolonial potentials as well as on the neocoloni-al risks inherent to Development-Collaboration Research along the lines of “Tradi-Mad”, a project that I’m part of as a PI. This interdisciplinary project involving phar-macologists and anthropologists of medicine aims at a better understanding of the relationship between modern medicine and traditional practices of healing in order to allow for a better, ‘integrative’ medical care on Madagascar. As a newcomer to Development-Collaboration Research, I am irritated about the fact that post- and decolonial perspectives have so far remained largely absent within the complex application-procedure and official discussions between colleagues. An absence that is quite unnerving in as far as it allows adherence to well-established research agendas without ever having to address the simultaneously ethically and epistemo-logically questionable omissions inherent in these routines. Omissions that are mainly based on the never rendered explicit, but consensual assumption that those parts of traditional healing practices that cannot be summed up in a biomedically recordable combination of molecules, must be considered as nothing but placebo effects: Rituals etc. might heal, but do so for “bad reasons”. Going back to the crucial role procedures of disqualification have played within the history of modern medi-cine, might help position oneself in the interdisciplinary and geopolitical dance of this and similar p</p>
