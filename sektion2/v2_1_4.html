<p>This talk reflects on the post- and decolonial potentials as well as on the neocolonial risks inherent to Development-Collaboration Research along the lines of “Tradi-Mad”, a project that I’m part of as a PI. This interdisciplinary project involving pharmacologists and anthropologists of medicine aims at a better understanding of the relationship between modern medicine and traditional practices of healing in order to allow for a better, ‘integrative’ medical care on Madagascar. As a newcomer to Development-Collaboration Research, I am irritated about the fact that post- and decolonial perspectives have so far remained largely absent within the complex application-procedure and official discussions between colleagues. An absence that is quite unnerving in as far as it allows adherence to well-established research agendas without ever having to address the simultaneously ethically and epistemologically questionable omissions inherent in these routines. Omissions that are mainly based on the never rendered explicit, but consensual assumption that those parts of traditional healing practices that cannot be summed up in a biomedically recordable combination of molecules, must be considered as nothing but placebo effects: Rituals etc. might heal, but do so for “bad reasons”.
